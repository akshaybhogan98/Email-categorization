Categorize Emails according to labels

Emails have become one of the major applications in daily life. The continuous growth in the number of email users has led to a massive increase of unsolicited emails, which are also known as spam emails. Managing and classifying this huge number of emails is an important challenge.I  have used two different approaches here—Naïve Bayes classifier and k-nearest neighbors algorithm. The Naïve Bayes classifier is based on a probabilistic model, while the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is based on a similarity measure with the training emails.
